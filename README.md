# AndroidApp
A simple android mobile app developed for my final year design project using Java with Android Studio IDE.
It is developed to communicate with Arduino by sending signals in String format via USB Serial Communication.
The function of the Arduino to is control the measurement modes for Resistance, Inductance, and Capacitance based on the signal received from the App. 
The measured values are then send back to the Mobile App and display. \ 

The implementation of Mobile App is to eliminate the use of battery as per commercial Multimeter. The Smartrphone can act as a power supply to the Arduino, measurement mode controller, as well as to display the measured values
